    <p> Warm French toast topped with a cream cheese frosting. This is a reduced-fat version of what my sister serves for breakfast whenever they have company. It is incredible! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups skim milk </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, cut into 3/4 inch slices </li>
        <li>¼ cup butter </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package fat-free cream cheese, softened </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fat-free sour cream </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons frozen whipped topping, thawed </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon. Melt one tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip a few bread slices into the egg mixture just to coat. Place in the hot skillet, and cook until golden on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining slices of bread. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the skillet before frying each batch of toast.</li>
        <li>While the toast is cooking, mix cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of sugar, sour cream, and whipped topping using an electric mixer or blender until smooth, yet firm.</li>
        <li>Place servings of warm French toast onto plates, and top with a generous dollop of the frosting.</li>
    </ol>
